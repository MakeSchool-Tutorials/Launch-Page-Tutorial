Make School tutorials should have a consistent flow, which starts by stating all expectations of a tutorial upfront in the first chapter. This is a short guide to structuring the first chapter of a tutorial so that students are fully aware of what they're building, why they're doing it, what they need to know before diving in, and a reminder of tools to use.

**This entire file can be cloned for the header sections, formatting as well as for specific copy, such as the git/github or Learning Outcomes section.**

# Overview

Use this section to give a brief overview of what the students will be building in the tutorial. This should summarize what the student will build and what tools they'll use.

A screenshot or video of the final product should be shown here as well, so that students can get a preview of the end product that they'll be building.

**When copying this for your tutorial, remember that since this is the first section, you don't need a header**


# Learning Outcomes

List 5-8 learning outcomes for the tutorial. These should concepts or ideas that the student should now have a solid understanding of by the end of the tutorial (example: Understand how WebSockets work within a server/client relationship through socket.io).

Be sure to use the language from the _Student Learning Outcomes_ (PDF Page 30) chapter of the [WASC Program Assessment Binder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15GeE0LsGH73TNk2BVHd8VgbKnDb80N2j). Specific action verbs are given on PDF pages 35-36.

The following format should be used for this section:

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to...

1. Learning Outcome 1
1. Learning Outcome 2
1. Learning Outcome 3
1. Learning Outcome 4
1. Learning Outcome 5
1. Learning Outcome 6
1. Learning Outcome 7
1. Learning Outcome 8

# Prerequisites

This section should outline any prerequisites for understanding the material and link to resources for getting up to speed.

Resources can include (but are not limited to):

- Class slides/materials
- Previous tutorials
- Outside references (articles/tutorials not from Make School)

# Using Git/GitHub

Good to remind students to set up a git repo for their code and to commit along the way (more on commit reminders in the next section).

**For all 1.1 and 1.2 classes, please use the following text for this section**

As you go through this tutorial, you will also be making commits after completing milestones. This is a requirement, you must make a commit whenever the tutorial prompts you. This not only further enforces best practices for software engineering, but also will help you more easily figure out where a bug originated from if you break your progress up into discrete, trackable chunks.

When prompted to commit, you'll see a sample commit message. Feel free to use your own message, so long as it clearly and concisely covers the work done.

Lastly, the commit prompts in this tutorial should be the minimum amount of times you commit. If you want to do more commits, breaking your chunks into even smaller chunks, that is totally fine!

**For all 1.3 and higher classes, please use the following text for this section**

Much like we've done in earlier tutorials, make sure you're committing your code as you complete milestones. At a minimum, you should make a commit whenever the tutorial prompts you.
