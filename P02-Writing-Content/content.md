# Core content

After the intro, the tutorial should continue with the core content. Longer tutorials should be broken up into multiple pages.

> [info]
Each `h1` header (headers created with a single `#`) will create a new tutorial step when it's accessed from the online academy. Make sure each step makes sense as a step. All the content in a step should be related but short enough to be digestible.
